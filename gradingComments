Assignment 5 Comments:

sklearn:

new dataset. 5/5

random forest 5/5

GridSearchCV 5/5

Scatterplot 5/5

Belief Networks:

alarm queries 5/5

car queries 5/5

additional node 5/5

HMM:

load 5/5

generate 10/10

lander models 5/5

forward 7/10 - you're calling Viterbi from forward, which seems odd.

viterbi 11/15 - Viterbi should use max rather than sum to select the most 
probable prior state.
 

Utility:

q1 4/5
Rt 3 is 106.8min

q2 5/5

q3 1/2 - not rocky: 121 minutes - if it's rocky, we take rt1 instead.

q4 3/3

q5 2/2

q6 0/3 Since route 1 is better either way, the satellite is not helpful.

88/100
